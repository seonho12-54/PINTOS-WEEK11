### Alarm Clock

**Reimplement `timer_sleep()`, defined in `devices/timer.c`.**

Although a working implementation is provided, it **busy waits**, that is, it spins in a loop checking the current time and calling `thread_yield()` until enough time has gone by. Reimplement it to avoid busy waiting.

    void timer_sleep (int64_t ticks);
    

> Suspends execution of the calling thread until time has advanced by at least x timer ticks. Unless the system is otherwise idle, the thread need not wake up after exactly x ticks. Just put it on the ready queue after they have waited for the right amount of time.

`timer_sleep()` is useful for threads that operate in real-time, e.g. for blinking the cursor once per second. The argument to `timer_sleep()` is expressed in timer ticks, not in milliseconds or any another unit. There are `TIMER_FREQ` timer ticks per second, where `TIMER_FREQ` is a macro defined in `devices/timer.h`. The default value is `100`. We don't recommend changing this value, because any change is likely to cause many of the tests to fail.

Separate functions `timer_msleep()`, `timer_usleep()`, and `timer_nsleep()` do exist for sleeping a specific number of milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds, respectively, but these will call `timer_sleep()` automatically when necessary. You do not need to modify them. The alarm clock implementation is not needed for later projects, although it could be useful for project 4.
