### Priority Scheduling

**Implement priority scheduling and priority donation in Pintos.**

When a thread is added to the ready list that has a higher priority than the currently running thread, the current thread should immediately yield the processor to the new thread. Similarly, when threads are waiting for a lock, semaphore, or condition variable, the highest priority waiting thread should be awakened first. A thread may raise or lower its own priority at any time, but lowering its priority such that it no longer has the highest priority must cause it to immediately yield the CPU.

Thread priorities range from `PRI_MIN (0)` to `PRI_MAX (63)`. Lower numbers correspond to lower priorities, so that priority 0 is the lowest priority and priority 63 is the highest. The initial thread priority is passed as an argument to `thread_create()`. If there's no reason to choose another priority, use `PRI_DEFAULT (31)`. The `PRI_` macros are defined in `threads/thread.h`, and you should not change their values.

One issue with priority scheduling is "priority inversion". Consider high, medium, and low priority threads *H*, *M*, and *L*, respectively. If *H* needs to wait for *L* (for instance, for a lock held by *L*), and *M* is on the ready list, then *H* will never get the CPU because the low priority thread will not get any CPU time. A partial fix for this problem is for *H* to "donate" its priority to *L* while *L* is holding the lock, then recall the donation once *L* releases (and thus *H* acquires) the lock.

Implement priority donation. You will need to account for all different situations in which priority donation is required. Be sure to handle multiple donations, in which multiple priorities are donated to a single thread. You must also handle nested donation: if *H* is waiting on a lock that *M* holds and *M* is waiting on a lock that *L* holds, then both *M* and *L* should be boosted to *H*'s priority. If necessary, you may impose a reasonable limit on depth of nested priority donation, such as 8 levels.

You must implement priority donation for locks. You need not implement priority donation for the other Pintos synchronization constructs. You do need to implement priority scheduling in all cases.

Finally, implement the following functions that allow a thread to examine and modify its own priority. Skeletons for these functions are provided in `threads/thread.c`.

* * *
    
    
    void thread_set_priority (int new_priority);
    

> Sets the current thread's priority to new priority. If the current thread no longer has the highest priority, yields.

* * *
    
    
    int thread_get_priority (void);
    

> Returns the current thread's priority. In the presence of priority donation, returns the higher (donated) priority.

You need not provide any interface to allow a thread to directly modify other threads' priorities.

The priority scheduler is not used in any later project.
