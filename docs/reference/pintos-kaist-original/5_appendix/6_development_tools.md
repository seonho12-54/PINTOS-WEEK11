# Development Tools

Here are some tools that you might find useful while developing code.

## Tags

Tags are an index to the functions and global variables declared in a program. Many editors, including Emacs and vi, can use them. The `Makefile` in `pintos/` produces Emacs-style tags with the command make `TAGS` or vi-style tags with make tags.

In Emacs, use `M-`. to follow a tag in the current window, `C-x 4` . in a new window, or `C-x 5` . in a new frame. If your cursor is on a symbol name for any of those commands, it becomes the default target. If a tag name has multiple definitions, `M-0 M-`. jumps to the next one. To jump back to where you were before you followed the last tag, use `M-*`.

## cscope

The `cscope` program also provides an index to functions and variables declared in a program. It has some features that tag facilities lack. Most notably, it can find all the points in a program at which a given function is called.

The `Makefile` in `pintos/` produces `cscope` indexes when it is invoked as make `cscope`. Once the index has been generated, run `cscope` from a shell command line; no command-line arguments are normally necessary. Then use the arrow keys to choose one of the search criteria listed near the bottom of the terminal, type in an identifier, and hit `Enter`. `cscope` will then display the matches in the upper part of the terminal. You may use the arrow keys to choose a particular match; if you then hit `Enter`, `cscope` will invoke the default system editor [1](#fn_1) and position the cursor on that match. To start a new search, type `Tab`. To exit `cscope`, type `Ctrl-d`.

Emacs and some versions of vi have their own interfaces to `cscope`. For information on how to use these interface, visit the `cscope` home page (<http://cscope.sourceforge.net>).
