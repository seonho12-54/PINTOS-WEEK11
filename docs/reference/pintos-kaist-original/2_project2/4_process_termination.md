## Process Termination Message

**Print out the process termination message**

Whenever a user process terminates, because it called `exit` or for any other reason, **print the process's name and exit code**, formatted as if printed by
    
    
    printf ("%s: exit(%d)\n", ...);
    

The name printed should be the full name passed to `fork()`. Do not print these messages when a kernel thread that is not a user process terminates, or when the halt system call is invoked. The message is optional when a process fails to load.

Aside from this, don't print any other messages that Pintos as provided doesn't already print. You may find extra messages useful during debugging, but they will confuse the grading scripts and thus lower your score.
